BEM-like Naming
For larger, more interrelated pieces of UI that require a number of classes, we use a BEM-like naming convention.

BEM, meaning Block, Element, Modifier, is a front-end methodology. Whilst BEM is a complete methodology, here we are only concerned with its naming convention. 
Further, the naming convention here only is BEM-like; the principles are exactly the same, but the actual syntax differs slightly.

BEM splits componentsâ€™ classes into three groups:

Block: The sole root of the component.
Element: A component part of the Block.
Modifier: A variant or extension of the Block.

CSS Guideline
Commenting
Separate each section by title commenting
/*=============================================
section Name
============================================= */

1. First it should contain basic setup
2. Second part should be reusable content
3. Then go to each section and style it
4. Use multiple line
